# payroll-x-app
==============

## Description

This is a payroll application that allows you to enter in the first and last name of an employee and their salary. Then the app calculates the average salary. Then the app selects a winning employee at random. 

## Finished Product 

This is my completed payroll-x-app. You can also see in this image what's happening in the console after you enter in the employee name and their salaries:
